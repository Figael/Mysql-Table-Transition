It's nightmare to transit data of table from old to new one.
How to distinguish the tables is a big problem even you have documented it well.So I try to make it easy and controllable.

#First,
edit db.php, fill your db config.

#sencond,
put those files into where your webserver can parse and watch it with url.


And Enjoy!


Note:

Column Original:
if Ultimate Field doesn't existed in Original Table, Column 'Original Table In Greenï¼ŒUltimate Table In Red' would display only green parts and Column 'Function' appears for function.Or you can choose Original Field only if the function's value of the same line is '#' as default.
else column 'Original Field' would display option selector and checkbox formula,when u make formula checked, the option selecter failed, you should write the php function to transit data.

Hope it be helpful.
